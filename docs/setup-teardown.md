# Setup and Teardown

This page contains instructions for setting up and tearing down the electronics and Daedo equipment for tournaments.

## Setting Up

### Bring Equipment to the Ring

Daedo tech + other equipment will be stationed at or near Head Table. To set up a ring, bring the required hardware to the ring and follow the instructions.

Each ring should have:

* **1 ECTC laptop + charger**
  * charger should be in laptop bag
* **1 monitor** 
  * this may be supplied by the host school
* **1 display cable**
  * this may already be at the ring if the host school provides monitors
  * some ECTC laptops have display cables in the laptop bag
* **1 set of Daedo gear *that corresponds to the ring rumber that is being set up***
  * 1 base station + USB cable
  * 2 judge controllers
  * 2 hogu transmitters (if A/B team ring, consult Head Table)

### Setup

1. Connect laptop + charger and monitor to a power strip near the ring table(s).
::: info 
The host school is responsible for providing accesible power sources for each ring. Reach out to Head Table or a representative of the host school if there is no power available.
:::
2. Power on the laptop and monitor, and use the display cable to connect the monitor to the laptop. Ensure the monitor is set up as a secondary/external display.
3. Connect the laptop to the internet. Most laptops should be able to automatically connect to `eduroam`. If not, ask for help to get connected to the internet.
4. Open Chrome. The homepage should be set to Google Drive- navigate to the correct folder for the current tournament. 
5. ???
6. Profit (#TODO: finish the correct setup tips, OBS still a thing? Discord? etc)

## Transitioning to Sparring
::: warning
Only do this once Head Table requests a ring be transitioned to sparring!
:::
::: danger
Make sure you do Step 1 first before moving on! Sometimes the TkStrike Gen2 software freaks out if the base station is connected before the software is open.
:::
1. Open the TkStrike Gen2 software on the ECTC laptop
2. Ensure the external monitor settings are set to "Extend" the laptop display (not duplicate!). You can do this in the Windows system settings.
3. Connect the base station to the laptop with its USB cable
4.  


## Tearing Down

::: warning
Make sure Head Table has cleared the ring to be taken down!
