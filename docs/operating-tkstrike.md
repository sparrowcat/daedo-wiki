# Operating TkStrike

This page shows the instructions for operating the TkStrike software

## Setting up a Match

## Hardware Test

::: tip
This step is primarily relevant if you are running an A or B team ring. C team rings will typically only request a hardware test if the corner judge controllers are acting up.

## Running a Match

::: tip
Your most important job during a match is to follow what the center ref says and communicate with the center ref.
:::

To start a round, click "Start Round" on the right-hand menu. Alternatively, you can use the hotkey "Enter".
